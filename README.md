# 24/7 Simpsons Streamer
### v.0.8.0
## An UNOFFICAL "The Simpsons" Chrome Extension that creates a constantly-running marathon of "The Simpsons" on Disney+.

## To Do
- Unchecked runtime.lastError: The page keeping the extension port is moved into back/forward cache, so the message channel is closed.
- Big thanks to https://thomaspark.co/
- The pause to sync is not being held until the second timeout, possibly due to the button presses happening before the first timeout.
- Catch user trying to skip around and trigger sync.
- Visual indicator that syncing is in progress.
- Add debug info to popup to determine start date needed for specific episodes
- Test triggering movie
- Account for 45-ish seconds of credits
- Fix Time API spamming and end of episodes getting stuck in a loop (potentially while waiting for first Time API trigger to correct times)
